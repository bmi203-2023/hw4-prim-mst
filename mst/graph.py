        TODO: Given `self.adj_mat`, the adjacency matrix of a connected undirected graph, implement Prim's 
        algorithm to construct an adjacency matrix encoding the minimum spanning tree of `self.adj_mat`. 
            
        `self.adj_mat` is a 2D numpy array of floats. Note that because we assume our input graph is
        undirected, `self.adj_mat` is symmetric. Row i and column j represents the edge weight between
        vertex i and vertex j. An edge weight of zero indicates that no edge exists. 
        
        This function does not return anything. Instead, store the adjacency matrix representation
        of the minimum spanning tree of `self.adj_mat` in `self.mst`. We highly encourage the
        use of priority queues in your implementation. Refer to the heapq module, particularly the 
        `heapify`, `heappop`, and `heappush` functions.
